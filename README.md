# TransBorder Freight Data Analysis

This README outlines the steps implemented in the Python script and the tools used for the analysis in this project.

## Overview
The project analyzes TransBorder Freight Data using the CRISP-DM framework. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploration, transformation, and visualization of freight transportation data.

## Tools Used
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:

- **Python**: Primary programming language for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To organize and execute the Python code interactively.

## Steps in the Python Script

### 1. **Data Loading**
- Import necessary libraries.
- Load monthly TransBorder Freight datasets into Pandas DataFrames.
- Merge these monthly datasets into yearly datasets for efficient analysis.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handle missing values by either filling or removing them based on context.
- Rename columns for consistency and readability.
- Filter out irrelevant data entries.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
- Perform type conversions (e.g., converting columns to appropriate data types).
- Create additional features or columns that provide meaningful insights (e.g., aggregating freight data by region).

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) for key variables.
- Create visualizations to understand trends and patterns, such as:
  - Line plots for freight trends over time.
  - Bar charts for top trading partners.
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

### 5. **Insights and Interpretation**
- Analyze the visualizations and statistical outputs to identify trends and anomalies.
- Summarize key findings in text and visual form.

### 6. **Export Results**
- Save cleaned and transformed datasets to new CSV files.
- Export generated visualizations as image files for reporting.

## How to Run the Script

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.7 or higher).
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred editor (e.g., JupyterLab, VSCode).
4. Execute each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.
5. Review the outputs, including visualizations and exported files.

## Notes
- Ensure all raw datasets are stored in the appropriate directory as specified in the script.
- Modify file paths and other configurations based on your system setup.
